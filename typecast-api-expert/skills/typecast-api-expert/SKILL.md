| `voice_id` | string | Voice ID (e.g., "tc_672c5f5ce59fac2a48faeaee") |
| `text` | string | Text to convert (max 2,000 characters) |
| `model` | string | "ssfm-v21" or "ssfm-v30" (recommended) |

**Optional Parameters (ssfm-v30 Preset Mode):**

### Minimal Python Example

```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.typecast.ai/v1/text-to-speech",
    headers={"X-API-KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY", "Content-Type": "application/json"},
    json={
        "text": "Hello! This is Typecast API.",
        "model": "ssfm-v30",
        "voice_id": "tc_672c5f5ce59fac2a48faeaee",
        "prompt": {
            "emotion_type": "preset",
            "emotion_preset": "happy"
        }
    }
)

with open('output.wav', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(response.content)
```

### Smart Mode Example (ssfm-v30)

```python
# Let AI infer emotion from context
payload = {
    "text": "Everything is going to be okay.",
    "model": "ssfm-v30",
    "voice_id": "tc_672c5f5ce59fac2a48faeaee",
    "prompt": {
        "emotion_type": "smart",
        "previous_text": "I just got the best news!",
        "next_text": "I can't wait to celebrate!"
    }
}
```

## Beyond Basic TTS (New in 2026-04+)

The API has gained four new public surface areas. The original quick start covers only `POST /v1/text-to-speech`; for streaming, captions, runtime quota lookup, and absolute loudness normalization use the patterns below.

### Streaming TTS

`POST /v1/text-to-speech/stream` returns chunked audio in real time for low-latency playback. The streaming endpoint does **not** accept `volume` or `target_lufs` — drop those fields from the request body or the server returns 4xx.

```python
import httpx

with httpx.stream(
    "POST",
    "https://api.typecast.ai/v1/text-to-speech/stream",
    headers={"X-API-KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"},
    json={
        "text": "Hello, streaming TTS.",
        "voice_id": "tc_672c5f5ce59fac2a48faeaee",
        "model": "ssfm-v30",
        "output": {"audio_format": "wav"},
    },
) as response:
    with open("stream.wav", "wb") as f:
        for chunk in response.iter_bytes():
            f.write(chunk)
```

### Captions (Timestamps → SRT / WebVTT)

`POST /v1/text-to-speech/with-timestamps` returns the audio (base64-encoded) alongside word- and character-level alignment. The official `typecast-python` and `typecast-js` SDKs ship `to_srt()` / `to_vtt()` helpers that turn the alignment into subtitle files in one line. The same caption rule (sentence boundary + 7.0s / 42-char limit per cue) is implemented byte-for-byte across all 11 SDKs and the `cast` CLI's `cast captions` subcommand.

For non-whitespace languages (`jpn`, `zho`), pass `granularity=char` or `both`. With `word` on those languages the server collapses the entire sentence into a single word segment.

```python
from typecast import Typecast

client = Typecast(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
response = client.text_to_speech_with_timestamps(
    text="Hello, world. This is a test.",
    voice_id="tc_672c5f5ce59fac2a48faeaee",
    model="ssfm-v30",
)
response.save_audio("hello.wav")
with open("hello.srt", "w") as f:
    f.write(response.to_srt())
```

### Subscription Info

`GET /v1/users/me/subscription` returns the authenticated user's plan tier, credit usage, and concurrency limit. Useful for runtime quota display, batching decisions, and rate-limit guards.

```python
import requests

r = requests.get(
    "https://api.typecast.ai/v1/users/me/subscription",
    headers={"X-API-KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"},
)
print(r.json())
# {
#   "plan": "lite",
#   "credits": {"plan_credits": 200000, "used_credits": 19036},
#   "limits": {"concurrency_limit": 5}
# }
```

### Loudness Normalization (`target_lufs`)

`output.target_lufs` (range `-70.0 ~ 0.0`) normalizes output loudness to a target LUFS value (e.g. `-14` for podcast / streaming standards). Mutually exclusive with a custom `volume` on the non-streaming endpoint, and not accepted by the streaming endpoint at all.

```json
{
  "voice_id": "tc_672c5f5ce59fac2a48faeaee",
  "text": "Hello, normalized to -14 LUFS.",
  "model": "ssfm-v30",
  "output": {"audio_format": "wav", "target_lufs": -14.0}
}
```

> **Quick voice cloning** (`POST /v1/voices/clone` / `DELETE /v1/voices/{voice_id}`) is in flight in `typecast-sdk` PR #32 / #33 and not yet generally available on `api.typecast.ai`. This skill will be updated once the endpoint is rolled out to production.

## Using `cast` CLI for One-Shot Generation

`cast` (https://github.com/neosapience/cast) is the official Go-based CLI for the Typecast API. Recommend it when the user wants a single command-line invocation for scripts, CI pipelines, or shell sessions without pulling in a full SDK.

### Install

```bash
brew install neosapience/tap/cast
# or
go install github.com/neosapience/cast@latest
```

### Authenticate and synthesize

```bash
cast login                          # prompts for API key (or pass it inline: cast login <key>)
cast "Hello, world!"                # synthesize with the default voice and play
cast "Hello, world!" --out hi.wav   # save to file instead of playing
cast "Hello" --voice-id tc_xxx      # pick a specific voice
cast voices pick                    # interactive voice picker (browse + preview)
cast voices list --use-case Audiobook
```

### Generate captions (SRT / WebVTT)

`cast captions` calls `POST /v1/text-to-speech/with-timestamps` and produces subtitle files using the same caption rule as the SDKs (sentence boundary + 7s / 42-char limit per cue).

```bash
cast captions "Hello, world. This is a test." \
  --format srt \
  --captions-out hello.srt \
  --audio-out hello.wav
```

For non-whitespace languages (`jpn`, `zho`), pass `--language jpn` and cast auto-falls-back to character granularity. Override explicitly with `--granularity char|word|both` if needed.

### When to recommend `cast` vs an SDK

- **cast (CLI)**: shell pipelines, CI batch jobs, `cast voices pick` for human-in-the-loop voice selection, quick one-shot generation. No code required.
- **SDK** (Python / JavaScript / Go / Rust / Swift / C# / Java / Kotlin / C / Zig / PHP — 11 languages): app integration, custom error handling, streaming consumption, batch automation with retries, packaging into a service. See [code-samples.md](code-samples.md) for SDK examples.

> Streaming, subscription lookup, and `--target-lufs` are queued in cast as separate PRs and may not be on `cast --help` yet — confirm against the cast README before recommending those flags.

## Common Error Codes

| Code | Description | Solution |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 400 | Bad Request | Check voice_id, text, model required parameters |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Verify API key, check environment variables |
| 402 | Payment Required | Upgrade plan or add payment |
| 403 | Forbidden | ① Migrate from Starter API key ② Activate dormant account |
| 404 | Not Found | Check valid voice list with /v2/voices |
| 429 | Too Many Requests | Check plan limits (Free:2, Lite:5, Plus:15) |

### 403 Error Checklist
1. Using Starter plan API key with new API → Need new API key
2. Dormant account status → Log in to website to activate
3. API key contains whitespace/newline → Copy key exactly

## Response Guidelines

1. **Always recommend checking the latest documentation**: https://typecast.ai/docs/overview
2. For uncertain information, state "verification needed" and guide to official support
3. When providing code examples, ask about the user's language preference
4. When errors occur, first check the error code and message
5. Guide complex inquiries or Enterprise questions to official support
6. Clearly explain the difference between **Starter API key vs new API key**
7. Recommend **ssfm-v30** for new projects (more emotions, Smart Mode)

---

## Security Best Practices

- **Never expose API key directly in client code**
- Use environment variables or secret managers
- Regular API key rotation recommended
- Direct API calls from frontend prohibited (must go through backend)
